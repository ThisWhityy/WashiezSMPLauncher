## I am working on a small launcher that can be used to update modpacks and MC versions!

This is a fork of the SKCraft Launcher, however there are a lot of fixes for the Java environment, updates to deprecated packages etc included! This project has been customised for newer versions and specific modloaders other than forge!

WIP

Cheers, Tom <3
